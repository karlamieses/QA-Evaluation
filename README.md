# Plug QA Evaluation

Welcome to Karla's QA evaluation! 

This repository contains the automation testing for Plug extension Landing Page, which utilizes as automation tool Cypress. 

Bad new beforehand: Unfourtunately, I was unable to interact with the Plug Extension, I know there's a way to do it with Cypress and Puppeteer, or directly with Puppeteer, also with Playwright, Selenium with Jest...among others, I tried them ALL! Literally, all...I also reviewed in your repo (under the tests folder) how you guys have it set, but it did not work for me not sure what I have done wrong, I would love to hear the solution of this, that's why I decided to continue with Cypress which was my first Automation Tool option. 

The test contains what I would be validation IF I could have made it to access to the Plug browser extension.

ðŸš€ Download & Make it "run"

1. Clone the repo in your machine
2. Open your terminal and type npx cypress open
3. The Cypress test runner will open
4. Click on the landingPage spec file
5. The browser will open and you should be able to see the Plug extension in it, but won't be able to interact with it (sad face)

Additional Notes:

To evaluate the code you can go to Cypress > Integration > landingPage.spec
